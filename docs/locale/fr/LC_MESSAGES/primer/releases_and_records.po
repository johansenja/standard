"OCDS publishers are encouraged to use releases and records to publish data "
"in near real-time and to provide a change history. Tracking change over time"
" is important to users of contracting data because there can be many changes"
" in the life of a contracting process. Knowing how and when certain "
"attributes have changed can help users to understand the process, identify "
"inefficiencies, and spot red flags for corruption."

"A **record** is JSON data that acts as an index of all releases for a single"

"structures to represent information. For example, a release may contain "
"information about items being procured. OCDS’ schema sets out standard "
