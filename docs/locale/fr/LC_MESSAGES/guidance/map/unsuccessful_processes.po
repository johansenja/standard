"In the case of procurement, a contracting process can be defined as a "
"procurement procedure. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the "

"In OCDS, at a conceptual level, a contracting process is intended to match "
"each concrete attempt to start a procedure that leads to one or more "
"contracts. Attempts can include: an invitation to tender (in open "
"procedure); an invitation to request to participate; a competition for a "
"concession; a direct award, etc."

"In OCDS, the `ocid` is the unique identifier for a contracting process. As "

"In most jurisdictions, if a procedure is cancelled or unsuccessful, and a "
"**new procedure** is started to procure the same items, the two procedures "
"are considered two **different** contracting processes. This is in keeping "
"with the OCDS definition of a contracting process."

"But in other jurisdictions, such as Paraguay, planning is considered as "
"initiating the process. In these jurisdictions when a tender fails and a new"
" tender is started, the two tenders are considered part of the same "
"contracting process. This differs from the OCDS definition of a contracting "
"process."

"In OCDS, it is relevant and desirable to disclose information about "
"planning, but the contracting process is not interpreted as \"starting\" "
"with planning. In OCDS, the planning process is something that comes "
"**before** the initiation of a contracting process. The initiation of the "
"procedure is not the planning process, because at least one of the following"
" is true of a planning process: it is not a concrete attempt to award one or"
" more contracts like a request for tender, etc.; it is not a concrete "
"opportunity for potential suppliers to participate in; it does not describe "
"the competitive conditions."
